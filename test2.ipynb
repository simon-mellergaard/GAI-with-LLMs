Annotators can make mistakes or disagree, while labels that are inferred from other features can be wrong. If it was easy to automatically annotate data, then we would not need a model to do it. Thus, it is normal that there are some wrongly labeled examples. With this approach, we can quickly find and correct them.\n\n- _Quirks of the dataset_:: Datasets in the real world are always a bit messy. When working with text, special characters or strings in the inputs can have a big impact on the model's predictions.

We have seen two complementary approaches based on features and fine-tuning, and investigated their strengths and weaknesses. \n\nHowever, this is just the first step in building a real-world application with transformer models, and we have a lot more ground to cover. Here's a list of challenges you're likely to experience in your NLP journey:\n\nMy boss wants my model in production yesterday!::\nIn most applications, your model doesn't just sit somewhere gathering dust - you want to make sure it's serving predictions! When a model is pushed to the Hub, an inference endpoint is automatically created that can be called with HTTP requests. We recommend checking out the [documentation](https://api-inference.huggingface.co/docs/python/html/index.html) of the Inference API if you want to learn more. \n\nMy users want faster predictions!::\nWe've already seen one approach to this problem: using DistilBERT. In <<chapter_compression>> we'll dive into knowledge distillation (the process by which DistilBERT was created), along with other tricks to speed up your transformer models.\n\n\nCan your model also do X?::\nAs we've alluded to in this chapter, transformers are extremely versatile. In the rest of the book we will be exploring a range of tasks, like question answering and named entity recognition, all using the same basic architecture.\n\nNone of my texts are in English!::\nIt turns out that transformers also come in a multilingual variety, and we'll use them in <<chapter_ner>> to tackle several languages at once.\n\nI don't have any labels!::\nIf there is very little labeled data available, fine-tuning may not be an option. In <<chapter_fewlabels>>, we'll explore some techniques to deal with this situation.\n\nNow that we've seen what's involved in training and sharing a transformer, in the next chapter we'll explore implementing our very own transformer model from scratch.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
